Thanks for wanting to contribute to Dasharr !

## Quickstart :

- clone the repo
- start a postgresql database (the easiest way is with the one in `compose.yml`: `docker compose up db -d`)
- create `.env` files from the `.env.example` ones in `backend/` and `frontend/` and edit the values you want
- (optional, if you want to work on the frontend) install the frontend dependencies and run it: `cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev`
- install the backend dependencies and run it: `cd backend && cargo run`
- start coding !

## What to do ?

Looking for something to do ?

- Many indexers are still to be added
- Have a look at the issues of the repo

Don't hesitate to get in touch on `#dev` on the discord server (link in the README)
